# HanoiTower
This repository contains the second major project I did for my COSC 220 course (taken during the Spring 2020 at Salisbury University taught by Dr. Joseph Anderson). This involved simulating a hanoi tower "game" and includes the recursive algorithm for the solving of hanoi tower. Concepts used: overriden operators and stacks.
