This file contains three runs of the Hanoi Towers Project
for COSC 220 (codeed by: Will Townsend):

This program is to function like the real Hanoi Towers problem.
(This program does not include the operator<< like instructed,
but still works as intended with all bonuses).

Run 1 (Showcases the correctness of the solveHanoi() recursive
function):

How many disks: 1
Invalid Option (2-6)
How many disks: 8
Invalid Option (2-6)
How many disks: 3
